I like being first. I like the idea that if I'd got everything wrong, like I don't even know what csv *is* - then I'm fine for half an hour.

(maybe?) I usually talk about interactive demos and hacks, though this is going to be more useful.  You can tell, because I've picked a serif font for my slides.

# [fit] CSV

^
Yup!

# Things I really like about CSV:

* Accessibility - data for everyone
* It's the start of something, not the end

^
1. It's accessible - it allows such a wide range of people to get their hands on their data and do interesting things
2. It's the start, not the end - you're not like "I've got a csv file, job done", by giving someone that file there's an excitement about what they're going to do with it.
